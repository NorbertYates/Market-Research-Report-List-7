<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Allergy Diagnostic Testing Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Blood Testing</li><li>Skin Testing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Allergy diagnostic testing primarily includes two main types: blood testing and skin testing. Blood testing, such as specific IgE measurement, involves analyzing a blood sample to detect antibodies produced in response to allergens. This method is useful for individuals unable to undergo skin tests. Skin testing, which includes prick or intradermal tests, involves applying allergens directly onto the skin to observe reactions. Both methods help identify specific allergies, guiding effective treatment and management strategies for patients.</p></p>
