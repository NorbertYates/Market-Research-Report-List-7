<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Otoacoustic Emissions (OAE) Screening Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Transent Evoked Otoacoustic Emissions</li><li>Distortion Product Otoacoustic Emission</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Otoacoustic Emissions (OAE) screening systems are essential tools for assessing hearing function. There are two primary types: Transient Evoked Otoacoustic Emissions (TEOAE) and Distortion Product Otoacoustic Emissions (DPOAE). TEOAE measures the ear's response to short sounds, providing information about the cochlea's function. In contrast, DPOAE evaluates the ear's response to two simultaneous tones, offering a more detailed analysis of hearing sensitivity. Both methods are crucial for early detection of hearing impairments, particularly in newborns and children.</p></p>
