<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Medical Respiratory Tract Humidifier Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Type</li><li>Passive Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The medical respiratory tract humidifier market is divided into two main types: active and passive. Active humidifiers actively add moisture to the air using mechanisms such as heated water or ultrasonic vibrations, providing precise humidity control tailored for patient needs. In contrast, passive humidifiers utilize the ambient air's moisture, typically through a heat and moisture exchanger (HME), to maintain humidity levels. Both types serve essential roles in improving patient comfort and respiratory function during mechanical ventilation or oxygen therapy.</p></p>
