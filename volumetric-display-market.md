<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Volumetric Display Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Swept-Volume Display</li><li>Solid-Volume Display</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The volumetric display market is primarily categorized into two types: swept-volume displays and solid-volume displays. Swept-volume displays utilize rotating or moving elements to create 3D images, effectively sweeping through a volume to render visuals that can be viewed from multiple angles. In contrast, solid-volume displays generate images within a fixed volume using methods like holography or light field technology, displaying fully three-dimensional images that remain static in a designated space. Both types cater to unique applications in sectors like entertainment, medical imaging, and design.</p></p>
