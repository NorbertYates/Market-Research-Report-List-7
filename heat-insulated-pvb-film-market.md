<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Heat Insulated PVB Film Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Endothermic Film</li><li>Reflective Film</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The heat insulated PVB film market comprises two primary types: endothermic and reflective films. Endothermic films absorb heat, thus reducing the interior temperature of buildings by minimizing solar heat gain. This type often enhances energy efficiency and comfort. On the other hand, reflective films utilize reflective coatings to bounce back solar radiation, further aiding in temperature regulation and lowering cooling costs. Both types serve vital roles in energy conservation, making them popular choices in construction and automotive applications.</p></p>
