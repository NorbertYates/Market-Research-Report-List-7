<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mineral Insulated Metal Sheathed (MIMS) Thermocouples Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Grounded Type</li><li>Ungrounded Type</li><li>Exposed Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Mineral Insulated Metal Sheathed (MIMS) thermocouples market consists of three main types: grounded, ungrounded, and exposed types. Grounded thermocouples feature a direct electrical connection to the metal sheath, offering quick response times but potential interference in noisy environments. Ungrounded types have an insulated junction, providing electrical isolation and reduced interference but slower response times. Exposed thermocouples, designed without additional insulation, deliver rapid temperature readings but are more susceptible to damage and contamination. Each type serves specific applications based on sensitivity and environmental needs.</p></p>
